FINAL RESULTS:

src/Bar.c:779:  [5] (buffer) strncat:Easily used incorrectly (e.g., incorrectly computing the correct maximum size to add) [MS-banned] (CWE-120).
src/main.c:114:  [3] (format) printf:If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited (CWE-134).  Use a constant for the format specification.
src/Bar.c:246:  [1] (buffer) scanf:It's unclear if the %s limit in the format string is small enough (CWE-120).
